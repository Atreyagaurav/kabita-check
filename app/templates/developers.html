    <h3>Informations for Programmers/Developers</h3>
    The API is available in /api endpoint, right now these are the only endpoints available, I'll add more as I develop them.
    <ul class="uk-list uk-list-large">
	<li>The API for checking chanda is available in <strong>/api/check</strong> endpoint.<br />
	    POST request; JSON: {"text":"your kabita","rule":"rule in is"}, it'll return the analysis result as well as rendered HTML with mistakes highlighted in Red. You can leave the rule empty for autodetection of chanda rule.</li>
	<li>The API for chanda list is available in <strong>/api/all_chanda</strong> endpoint.<br />
	GET Request.</li>
	<li>The API for wordlist is available in <strong>/api/wordlist</strong>.<br />
	GET Request; JSON: {"rule":"rule for word", "word":"word to search"}, the rule and word follow same syntax as that of query parameters on browse words page.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4> Other details: </h4>
    <ul class="uk-list">
	<li>Save file and load file features are currently on hold. I'm not great with javascript so the development is super slow.</li>
	<li>I'd also like to integrate a nepali dictionary to check the correctness of words as well as chanda, and maybe suggest solutions for errors.
	But I ran into some problems on that, I have a simple dictionary, as you can see on the browse words page, but it can't check for errors due to -एको -एका -एकी problem and such.</li>
    </ul>
